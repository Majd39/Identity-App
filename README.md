# 🛡️ Identity App: Atomic Habits & AI-Powered Growth

> **"Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become."** > Inspired by James Clear's *Atomic Habits*, this app is engineered to bridge the gap between identity and action through AI.

## 🎯 Project Overview
**Identity App** isn't just a habit tracker; it's an identity-builder. By leveraging **On-device AI**, the app predicts behavioral patterns and optimizes habit triggers based on your daily routine.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 👤 1. Identity-Based Engine
* **Identity Definition:** Users define their target identity (e.g., *"Professional Boxer"* or *"Avid Reader"*).
* **Psychological Linking:** Every habit is strictly mapped to an identity to build long-term neuro-associations.

### ⚡ 2. Atomic Habit Management
* **The Two-Minute Rule:** Automated logic that suggests a simplified version of any habit to ensure you never miss a day.
* **Habit Stacking:** AI-driven prompts that suggest linking new habits to established anchors (e.g., *"After Prayer, do 10 pushups"*).
* **Visual Satisfaction:** Streak tracking visualized with high-quality **Lottie Animations**.

### 🧠 3. AI & Intelligent Systems
* **Smart Audio Cues:** Customizable signal system to prompt action without screen interaction.
* **Relapse Prediction:** AI models analyze history to predict and prevent failure days.
* **NLP Categorization:** Automatic classification of habits using Natural Language Processing.
