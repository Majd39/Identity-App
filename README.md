Identity App: Atomic Habits & AI-Powered GrowthIdentity App is a specialized habit-tracking mobile application inspired by the philosophy of "Atomic Habits" by James Clear. The app focuses on identity-based growth, leveraging On-device AI to optimize behavioral change and habit consistency.🚀 Key Features1. Identity-Based SystemIdentity Definition: Users can define the person they aspire to become (e.g., "Professional Boxer").Habit Linking: Every habit is strictly linked to a specific identity to reinforce the psychological connection between action and self-image.2. Smart Habit ManagementAtomic Operations: Full CRUD management for habits with time and frequency control.Two-Minute Rule: Automated suggestions for a simplified "2-minute version" of complex habits to lower the barrier to entry.Visual Progress: Dynamic streak tracking enhanced with Lottie Animations for immediate visual reward.3. AI & Intelligent NotificationsSmart Audio Cues: An automated cue system that triggers specific audio signals to prompt habit initiation.Habit Stacking (AI Voice): Uses AI to suggest optimal timings and vocal prompts to link new habits to existing anchors.Pattern Analysis: Predicting potential failure days (relapse) based on historical user data.🛠 Technical StackFrontend: Flutter (Mobile).State Management: GetX / BLoC.Backend: Laravel API (Data Sync & Cloud Backup).Database: Hive / SQLite (Local-First Architecture).AI/ML: On-device models for NLP categorization and pattern prediction.📦 Project Structure (Current Progress)The project is managed using Agile Scrum methodology.
